# Trash Excess

Trash Excess is a [Factorio][https://factorio.com] Mod.

Automatically trashes any amounts of items in your inventory that exceed their request amounts to your logistic trash slots.
Items are counted in all your inventories (as with requests) but only trashed from your main inventory, e.g. it won't trash items from your quickbar or your hand (which would be quite annoying).

This Mod is minimal and aims to stay that way: no GUI, no complicated setup, just do what you're supposed to do.
